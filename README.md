# Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis for Telecommunications
This project aims to develop a real-time network traffic analysis system for a telecommunications company. The system will monitor network traffic data, identify anomalies or patterns, and provide real-time insights to the network operation team. The project will utilize Apache Kafka for data ingestion and messaging, Structured Spark Streaming for real-time analytics, and a web-based dashboard for data visualization.

# Problem Statement
The telecommunications company generates a large volume of network traffic data every second. They want to:
<p> i. Monitor the network traffic in real-time
<p> ii. Identify any anomalies or patterns that could indicate issues or opportunities for improvement
<p> iii. Visualize the data to provide insights to the network operation team
    
# Solution Overview
The proposed solution involves the following steps:

<p> i. Set up a Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud and configure Kafka topics for ingesting network traffic data.
<p> ii. Implement a Python script to generate network traffic data and publish it to the network-traffic Kafka topic.
<p> iii. Use Structured Spark Streaming to ingest data from the network-traffic Kafka topic and perform real-time analytics on the data.
<p> iv. Implement stateless transformations (e.g., select, filter, groupBy) to analyze the data in real-time.
<p> v. Utilize sliding window operations and window-based aggregations to identify any patterns or anomalies in the data.
<p> vi. Publish the processed data to the processed-data Kafka topic.
<p> vii.  Use a web-based dashboard (e.g., Grafana) to visualize the processed data in real-time, providing insights to the network operation team.

# Project Setup
<p> Set up a Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud: Follow the Confluent Cloud documentation to create a Kafka cluster and obtain the necessary configuration details (e.g., bootstrap servers, API keys).
<p> Create Kafka topics: Create two Kafka topics named network-traffic and processed-data in the Confluent Cloud cluster.
<p> Generate network traffic data: Implement a Python script using the kafka-python package to generate network traffic data. Publish the data to the network-traffic Kafka topic using the Kafka producer API.
<p> Ingest and process data using Structured Spark Streaming: Implement a Spark Streaming application to consume data from the network-traffic Kafka topic. Apply real-time analytics (e.g., filtering, aggregation, sliding window operations) to identify patterns and anomalies in the data. Publish the processed data to the processed-data Kafka topic.
<p> Visualize data using Grafana: Set up Grafana and connect it to the processed-data Kafka topic. Create interactive dashboards and visualizations to display real-time insights into the network traffic. Use graphs, charts, and alerts to highlight traffic trends, identify issues, and provide actionable insights to the network operation team.
    
# Conclusion
<p> The proposed real-time network traffic analysis system provides the telecommunications company with the ability to monitor and analyze network traffic data in real-time. By leveraging Apache Kafka, Structured Spark Streaming, and a web-based dashboard, the system enables the identification of anomalies, patterns, and insights to support network operation and decision-making processes. With continuous data ingestion, processing, and visualization, the telecommunications company can proactively address issues, optimize network performance, and improve overall operational efficiency.
